            <h4>Question 1</h4>
            <label for="">While each language has it's own learning curve and different people have their own predilections, there is generally an order in which web developers and programmers learn some basic languages. Please tell us what answer best suits your state of knowledge in code or similar fields. If more than one answer applies, pick the one that most suits your interest at the moment </label>

            <h4>Question 2</h4>
            <label for="question2">Programming can neatly be divided into two categories: <strong>front-end</strong> (also known as client-side ) and back-end (also known as business side). While front-end jobs may deal with the side of the website that deals with the user interface and experience(UX and UI). Backend developers deal with code that make a site or app work, including server intraction and database. It is incredibly important to have a basic understanding of both fields, but often students have a preference. Which side of web delveopment most appealst to you</label>

                    <p>...is a good match. PHP is a beginner-friendly, server-side scripting language with a long history, used in content heavy websites. Some notable examples of sites built with PHP include Facebook, Tumblr and Wordpress.</p>

                    <p>...a server-side scripting language, would be an excellent choice for you. Often used for enterprise-level development, people who specialize in Java often work for big companies. Did you know that <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2689406/java-platform/four-reasons-to-stick-with-java-and-four-reasons-to-dump-it.html">90% of Fortune 500 companies use Java?</a> </p>

                    <p>...CSS/Design would be a great track for you to follow. CSS styles the content of the web, while Javascript is used to provide client-side interaction.  and the results provide a platform for you to interact more directly with users than other programming jobs. While somewhat dissimilar than the rest as far as programming languages, CSS has its own formidable challeneges, and mastery is well worth the effort.

                    <p>...you might want to look into Ruby, the darling of startups and small businesses. Written simliar to vernacular English, ruby is relatively quicker to learn, more intuitive, and offers huge range of possiblities for client-interaction. If start-ups and small businesses sound like a good environment for you, Ruby is your language.
